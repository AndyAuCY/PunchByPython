# PunchByPython
A simple and ugly python code to auto punch at the site of my school's system.

(using chrome)
1. pip install selenium
2. install chromedriver into python/Scripts
3. add the address of school's site in it (i deleted original link for privacy, in other words this program only fits my school's system)
4. write your information in info.txt in a format of "username+password+location+temperature"（don't forget '+'）
5. open cmd where the main.py is
6. execute "python main.py"
7. program executing...
8. if successful, records will be written in log.txt

IMPORTANT: without finishing the steps above, the program won't work!!!
